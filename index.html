                    The Mission Guatemala EHR Software supports a small
                    clinic in rural Guatemala where it allows over
                    10,000 underrepresented citizens access to healthcare.
                    It is maintained as a multi-semester long senior capstone
                    at Baldwin Wallace, where I have had the pleasure of working on it
                    since January 2024.
